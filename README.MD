# Supernova Empires 3

Supernova Empires 3 is the sequel for Supernova Empires 2 with some improvements

Supernova Empires 3, my next big update to my previous Modpack (Supernova Empires 2) I made a more compact modpack by picking the best and funniest mods from the previous one. The idea is to make it even harder so the player puts more effort and feels more rewarded for it. Now Draconic Evolution is something that the player can achieve later in the game and it will be the final stage of the gameplay. With awesome weapons and armour the player will aim to defeat the Chaos Dragon in The End Dimension. Or just have a faster way to shape their world with awesome tools. Getting there the player will obviously have the use of different mods. Of course the essentials are also here, Journey Map so the player can have a minimap and add waypoints so that they're never lost. Inventory Tweaks, Item Filters, Refined Storage, Morpheus, Clumps all designed for a boost on the vanilla experience by fixing and/or upgrading those elements, both in singleplayer and multiplayer. And of course, the funny mods just for the sake of it, Chisel is a mod that will give some style to some blocks.
